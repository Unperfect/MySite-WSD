					<p class="about_me">Photography has always been a hobby/love of mine since I was a child. Although I always loved taking photos, photography <em>truly</em> became my passion when my children were born. Watching them grow up through the lens of my camera made me realize how <em>precious</em> life really is and you need to <strong>capture the memories that will last a forever</strong>.</p>
